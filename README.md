# Disease-diffusion-framework
This is a comprehensive framework at a fine scale to establish the disease transmission network and a mathematical model, which constructs "source-sink" links between the imported and indigenous cases on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 1 km to explore the diffusion pattern and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of imported cases.
